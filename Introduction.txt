Cloud Computing is a revolution in IT that's changing the way we consume computing services.



Characteristics:
1) On-Demand self service
2) Ubiqutous network access
3) Resource Pooling 
4) Rapid elasticity
5) Pay-per-Use


-> Cloud computing has three Delivery Models:
1) SaaS : SalesForce        (Finished Application that you rent and customize)                            WebBrowser
2) PaaS : Google App Engine (Cloud version of Application Development, Deployment and testing platform)   Deployment
3) IaaS :                   (Deployment platform that abstracts your infrastructure(sw))                  Data Centers

IaaS is the fastest growing. In this a 3rd party provider hosts hw, sw, servers, storage, and other infrastructure 
components  on behalf of the end user. Provides elastic-scaling(i.e scaling up or scaling down depending on the needs)
eg: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure 

SaaS    CRM(Content Resource Management) once see https://www.lynda.com/Cloud-Computing-tutorials/SaaS-clouds/508619/546863-4.html

PaaS: A new trend is to integrate and combine both PaaS and IaaS. (https://www.lynda.com/Cloud-Computing-tutorials/PaaS-clouds/508619/546864-4.html)
eg: AWS' Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine

-> and has three Deployment Models:
1) Private (More Secure) : Computing is done in your premises => You'll have more security but you are limited to running on your Hw and Sw
2) Public (Elastic Scaling) : Less secure but you'll leverage the power of 
3) Hybrid (Best of Private + Public)

Very recently, Besides IT, technologies such as Machine Learning and Big Data are entering the field.

Remember, theresn't a one-cloud fits-all solution.
