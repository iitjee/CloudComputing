 Microsoft offers a public cloud offering called Microsoft Azure. This offering contains many services that, in essence, provides technology capabilities as a utility, just like a power provider does for electricity. This model is very useful, because it provides some major benefits. The most important benefits of utilizing cloud computing are ease of use. You just consume technology services, like computing power from the cloud. This is easy to use and to keep using, because you no longer have to buy and maintain physical hardware anymore. And for certain cloud services, you don't even have to install and maintain servers. 
 <br/>
 Scalability. The cloud provides endless scale; you can easily scale up and down, depending on your needs. No need to buy many servers because you might need them. Also, this enables you to run workloads that you never could run on premises. And, pay for what you use. As you consume technology services from the cloud, you just pay for the services that you use when you use them.

 AZURE APP SERVICES;
 Azure provides the app services through the app service fabric. This abstracts the servers and underlying resources through the app services. The service fabric takes care of hosting your app on the Azure resources it uses, and makes sure that your app keeps running. All that you need to worry about is your application in the app service. There are several different app service types, each on geared towards a specific purpose.
  <br/>
 There is the Web App app service. With Web Apps, you can host web applications. You deploy your web application into a Web Apps app service. 
  <br/>
 There are API Apps. These can host your APIs and make them discoverable. You can build your own API, or bring your existing one and host it in an API app. 
  <br/>
 And then there are Logic Apps. These offer a place where you can create a complex workflow to automate a business process. In a Logic App workflow, you can call APIs that live anywhere, in Azure, on premises, or somewhere else. Logic Apps hosts and executes these workflows for you. With mobile apps, you can host a backend for your mobile applications that you use from mobile devices, like IOS or Android devices. Mobile Apps offers unique capabilities, like the ability for mobile clients to work offline and sync their changes back up. Mobile Apps also offers the ability to use push notifications.
  <br/>
 And, there are Function Apps. These provide a way to run an independent piece of code that can respond to an event, like when a new BLOB is added to BLOB storage. The code that a Function App hosts and executes is independent; it's not part of a website or another application. 
  <br/>
 All of the app services run on top of the Azure Service Fabric, which provides them with resources. The app services share a bunch of capabilities, which make creating applications easier. These are things like Authentication and Authorization out-of-the-box, but also Scaling and connecting to on-premises resources, like a database that is running in your own datacenter, and also, Support and Troubleshooting. This is a great platform that enables you to focus on adding business value to your company, instead of being busy with plumbing infrastructure.
