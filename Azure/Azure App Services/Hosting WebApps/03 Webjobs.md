They basically run background services as a service. Think of it as being able to use a Windows service without the hassle of setting it up and managing the underlying infrastructure and operating system.


Web jobs can be triggered by outside sources, and this is beautiful. A web job can listen to sources like Azure Storage Queue, Blob, and WebHooks. All of these things can trigger a web job to perform some action. Alternatively, you can schedule a web job to run on a certain time, or you can kick them off manually. Web jobs run in parallel by default. If a web job, for instance, is triggered by a message on an Azure Queue, it kicks off its function one time. If there are many messages on the same queue, the web job kicks off multiple instances of this same function for these messages in parallel.


So what are web jobs? A web app uses one or more VMs under the hood. This is all magically orchestrated by the Azure Service Fabric, which abstracts the infrastructure away. 

A web app can have one or more web jobs. These are processes that run on the same VMs as the web app as background processes. This means that the web app and the web jobs share resources. If the web jobs are running high-intensity computing tasks, it could be that your web app doesn't perform well. This is also true the other way around. If your web app is very heavily used, your web jobs might not perform well. Keep that in mind when thinking about web jobs. 

This slide shows a typical scenario for a web job. I have a website, Website.demo, which requires users to create a subscription before they can proceed. Creating a subscription uses a lot of computing power and takes a long time, sometimes an hour, or so. We want to make sure that the web app doesn't buckle under the load of creating a subscription and is able to continue serving other users. Also, we want the user to be able to go off and do something else and be notified when he can proceed. The web app uses the Azure SQL database to store all its data in. Also, it uses an Azure Storage Queue to offload work to the web job.

In this case, we have a web job that is listening for new messages on the Azure Storage Queue. As this web job has to perform compute-intensive functions, this web job lives in another web app than my website. Suppose the user clicks the Create New User subscription button on the website. This, then, triggers the website to put a message on the Azure Storage Queue saying that it needs to create a new subscription. As the web job is listening through the queue, it gets notified if there is a new message on the queue and it retrieves it. Now the web job knows to create a new subscription and puts the new subscription data in the Azure Sequel Database once it's done. Once that it's done, the web job send an email to the user, which informs him that the subscription is ready to use. Now, the user can continue to work doing this with his subscription data, which the web app reads from the database. All of the heavy work was offloaded to the web job. This enabled the web app to continue working, and it enabled the user to get notified that he can proceed. Somethings to keep in mind about web jobs. This of web jobs as background processes. You can deploy all sorts of batch jobs in them. You can create a web job from scratch, using the Azure SDK case, or you can use a batch job that you already have and just deploy it as a web job.

You can deploy executables, command files, batch files, bash files, php, Phython, and JavaScript files. Also, you can use jar files, that's Java files, and Powershell files. Remember, web jobs use compute resources from the web app. If you have a compute-intensive function that you need your web job to run, don't have the web job running in your important production web app.
